# WebTodo: A simple todo application

## What it is:

WebTodo is a simple web application that allows users to create
and manage simple todo lists.

## What it does:

Users can create an account and create/manage simple todo lists.
Once logged in, users can add, edit, mark complete/incomplete, and delete
todo list items. Todo list items have a title (required) and note (optional).

## Technology used:

WebTodo is build using the Flask microframework for Python. I chose Flask for
this project because of its, more or less, "raw" nature. That is to say, there
aren't many "batteries included" in Flask as there are in other frameworks,
such as Django. As such, it really forced me to delve deep into understanding
Python as a language and made me think through exactly what I wanted to do
in order to get the app to work.

A live demo of WebTodo is hosted on Heroku. Poke around the code here and then
